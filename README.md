Learning 
I hold a degree in Project Management and Mathematics.  This training gave me a deep understanding in portfolio management, statistics, econometrics and conflict management. Thus, the daily use of this knowledge enabled me to efficiently manage planning processes in given programmes for which I designed suitable monitoring and evaluation systems as well.
